This repository contains everything but Lavalink, which is a java application(?) thing which allows audio to be sent over Discord.

Uses Discord.Net and Sharplink (C# wrappers).

Link to Lavalink: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink 
(If you want to be able to host this bot, scroll down to the bottom of the Lavalink page to see how to install it).
