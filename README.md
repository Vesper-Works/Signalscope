This repository contains everything but Lavalink, which is a java application(?) thing which allows audio to be sent over Discord.

Uses Discord.Net and Sharplink (C# wrappers).

Link to Lavalink: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink 
(If you want to be able to host this bot, scroll down to the bottom of the Lavalink page to see how to install it).

The only problem right now bug-wise that I've found is that if you kick the bot from a voice channel, it crashes!
